            <h5>About the process</h5>
            <p>Most foreign nationals need a work permit to work in Canada.</p>
            <p>There are 2 types of work permits.</p>
            
            <h6>Employer-specific work permit</h6>
            <p>An employer-specific work permit lets you work in Canada according to the conditions on your work permit, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the name of the specific employer you can work for</li>
                <li>how long you can work</li>
                <li>the location where you can work (if applicable)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before you apply for an employer-specific work permit, your employer must give you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a copy of your employment contract</li>
                <li>a copy of a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) or an offer of employment number (for LMIA-exempt workers)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h6>Open work permit</h6>
            <p>An open work permit lets you work for any employer in Canada, except for one that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>is listed as ineligible on the list of employers who have failed to comply with the conditions</li>
                <li>regularly offers striptease, erotic dance, escort services or erotic massages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can only get an open work permit in specific situations.</p>
